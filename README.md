### How to install a theme

To install a theme to your Open edX instance, you'll need to follow these

    the theme branch name into the script.

2.  Go to your Open edX server via WSL2 or SSH. Make sure you
    use the fullstack version. 

3.  Run the script `update_theme.sh`

4.  Enjoy the new awesome look of your Open edX ðŸ˜Ž

Everything else the script will do for you.

#### Detailed procedure (step-by-step)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### <a name="#step-1"></a>Step \#1

Choose a theme. You can try the themes on the @raccoongang 
[themex.io](https://themex.io/) page. Or you can find the available themes
and their respective Open edX versions from the list below:

-   Open edX Dogwood fullstack version

    -   [Marvel](https://themex.io/theme/marvel/)
        - `marvel-theme-dogwood`

    -   [Marvel Yellow](https://themex.io/theme/marvel-yellow/)
        - `marvel-yellow-theme-dogwood`

    -   [Marvel Blue](https://themex.io/theme/marvel-blue/)
        - `marvel-blue-theme-dogwood`

-   Open edX Eucalyptus fullstack version

    -   [Marvel](https://themex.io/theme/marvel/)
        - `marvel-theme-eucalyptus`

    -   [Marvel Yellow](https://themex.io/theme/marvel-yellow/)
        - `marvel-yellow-theme-eucalyptus`

    -   [Marvel Blue](https://themex.io/theme/marvel-blue/)
        - `marvel-blue-theme-eucalyptus`

##### <a name="#step-2"></a>Step \#2

Open [WSL2](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) shell and start your local Open edX instance. For example, when using  @Docker for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) and [Tutor](https://github.com/overhangio/tutor) by @OverhangIO, you can start the system by `tutor local start`

If you need to connect remotely (pretend server resides at `edx-marvel.raccoongang.com` and you can connect username `ubuntu`), open Terminal and go to your Open edX server via SSH by running a
command:  `ssh ubuntu@edx-marvel.raccoongang.com`

##### <a name="#step-3"></a>Step \#3

Assuming you chose the theme branch `marvel-yellow-theme-eucalyptus` in [Step \#1](#step1), run these commands one by one:

`git clone https://github.com/mavaddat-javid-education/edx-theme.git`

`cd edx-theme`

`./update_theme.sh marvel-yellow-theme-eucalyptus`

##### <a name="#step-4"></a>Step \#4

Now's time to enjoy! Go check how awesome your Open edX looks like. Please feel free to customize your
theme.

Please note:  Your edx-platform repository
should not have any uncommitted changes for updating a theme.
